## Overview
This application has the specific purpose of enabling the detection of movement patterns that may assist in the diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of symptom progression in multiple sclerosis. It is a project of the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with a team of dedicated researchers passionate about their work.

Through the analysis of movement patterns in simulated versions of classical neurological tests, such as the finger-to-nose and rapid finger movement tasks, we aim to identify novel patterns that can support better-informed decisions regarding this health condition.

For this purpose, we require access to your device’s camera in order to analyse movements in real time. No images or videos are recorded or stored. We also require access to your device’s motion sensors to ensure it is positioned correctly during the tests. No personal data is stored, and the information collected from the tests is used solely to contribute to scientific advancement. Your device’s IP address will be recorded only once, at the time you agree to participate in the study during your first login.

## Data We Collect

### Device IP Address
- **When**: Collected only once, during the first use of the app.  
- **Purpose**: To record and verify that the informed consent form was presented and agreed to, in compliance with clinical research regulations.  
- **Use**: Solely for fraud prevention and to ensure the consent process functions correctly.  
- **Linkage**: The IP address is **not** linked to the participant's personal identity.  
- **Tracking**: The IP address is **not** used for tracking.

### Device Model and Operating System Version
- **Purpose**: To adapt the software for performance and compatibility across devices.  
- **Use**: Solely for app functionality and performance adjustments.  
- **Tracking**: Not used for tracking or profiling.

### Motion Sensor Data
- **Purpose**: To calibrate and adjust the movement capture tests during sessions.  
- **Use**: Processed in real time only, not stored permanently.  
- **Tracking**: Not used for tracking.

## Data Storage and Sharing
- All collected data is used exclusively for the operation of the app within the scope of the clinical trial.  
- Data is not shared with third parties, except where required by law or ethics committee oversight.

## Security
We apply technical and organisational measures to protect collected data from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## Your Rights
Participants may request clarification about the data collected during the trial by contacting the research team.
